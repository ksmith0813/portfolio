# My Personal Portfolio App

I have recently updated my react portfolio app to reflect things I have learned in the last several years.

TODO list:

- Create Dashboard component contents

- Implement Redux, I am currently using React context

- Add theming

- Add Apollo Client, I am currently using axios
