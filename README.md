# My Personal Portfolio App

I have recently updated my react portfolio app to reflect things I have learned in the last several years.

This site uses:

- React Functional Components

- React Context

- ANT Design

- Axios

- SCSS

TODO list:

- Create Dashboard component contents

- Consider replacing React Context with Redux

- Add theming

- Add Apollo Client
